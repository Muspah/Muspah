You're not going to find an extended profile page which took hours to write, this "readme" merely exists as a place to drop my contact information, 
but feel free to drop me a line if you want to talk about something. 

Please direct questions or issues **regarding Minecraft plugins** in the appropriate sections on Github or SpigotMC.org resource discussions. 

If you're looking to collaborate or take over a project, send an email to the address mentioned above.
